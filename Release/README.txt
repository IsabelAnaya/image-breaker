made with qt

==================================

Tutorial
Select batch size (how many times the program will run)
Select shifts per copy (the maximum amount of breaks in an image)
Type batch name - it will be the prefix for each new image
Click choose image and select an image to apply breaks, or shifts to
Check preferences under "File", then click run
New images will be located in the export directory in your computer

==================================

Exporting
By default, new images will be placed in the same directory as the .exe
To change the export directory, change it in "File -> Preferences"
There will be (batch size x shifts per copy) new images, named
[batch name][run number]shift[shift number].[extension]

==================================

Disclaimer
IMAGE BREAKER creates copies of the base image, and will not effect
the original, unless it is in the export directory, has the same batch name,
and has a run and shift number.
Different images with different types or sources (ex. a downloaded .jpg versus
a .bmp from a camera) may have different results from shifts, which may be
entirely corrupted.
Some shifts may have little or no effect, and some may "censor" the image with
a solid color. Both are normal.
If you mess with the preference file and it breaks, that's on you. Delete the 
preference file and a new one should be generated.
